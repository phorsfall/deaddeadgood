title: Active Resource Callbacks

<p>It looks like <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activemodel">work is still on-going</a> to <a href="http://weblog.techno-weenie.net/2008/1/21/random-rails-tidbits">extract functionality common to Active Record and Active Resource into a new Active Model library</a>. Excellent. But I wanted to add a couple of callbacks to Active Resource and I wanted to do it quickly. Thankfully, <a href="http://joshpeek.com/">someone much smarter than me</a> has already <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/aae37bb4f7edd6a1820e420a60560369c6064f33">extracted callbacks from Active Record</a>, so getting something working was pretty straight forward.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">module ActiveResource
  module Callbacks
    CALLBACKS = %w( after_save after_destroy )
    
    def self.included(base)
      [:save, :destroy].each do |method|
        base.send :alias_method_chain, method, :callbacks
      end
      
      base.send :include, ActiveSupport::Callbacks
      base.define_callbacks *CALLBACKS
    end
    
    def save_with_callbacks
      returning save_without_callbacks do
        run_callbacks(:after_save) unless new?
      end
    end
    
    def destroy_with_callbacks
      returning destroy_without_callbacks do
        run_callbacks(:after_destroy)
      end
    end
  end
end

ActiveResource::Base.send :include, ActiveResource::Callbacks</code></pre>
