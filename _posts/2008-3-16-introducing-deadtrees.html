title: Introducing deadtre.es
---
<p>I suppose the laziest way to describe deadtre.es is as '<a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> for books'. I've been tinkering with it on and off over the last couple of months or so, and thought it time I polished off the roughest edges and gave it a mini-launch here. As far as functionality goes it's missing some fairly obvious stuff at the minute, but it's usable and includes a bookmarklet for adding books from the pages of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon</a> and a simple <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> feed should you want to display your reading list on your blog. If you want something a little more comprehensive you might want to check out <a href="http://www.librarything.com">Library Thing</a>, <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com">BookJetty</a> or maybe <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/wishlist/">Amazon Wish Lists</a>, but if you want a super simple way to keep and share a reading list you're more than welcome to give deadtre.es a go.</p>
